# Stitch

Stitch is an event management app designed for Mason students. 
Its purpose is to provide an interactive communication tool to 
manage studentsâ€™ events and other extracurricular activities. 
The app allows people to create events, with various levels of 
formality (it can be an organizational event such as a soccer game 
or someone looking for a friend to go with them on an impromptu bike ride).

Here are the goals for the minimum viable product that we had:
- Login authentication
- Display events to GMU users
- Create a new event

Here are the lower priority goals that we still have to implement:
- Join already existing events
- Time duration of a posted event
- Invite a friend to an event

Our team consisted of @sharonmjsoe @debugduck @mybatman200 and @hayderalhaddad
